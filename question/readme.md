## 🌟 Getting Started with GitHub’s API
New to GitHub’s API? These resources will help you get started:
### REST API Resources
REST is commonly regarded as the standard for designing web APIs. To learn more about creating integrations, retrieving data, automating your workflows, and building with the GitHub REST API, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28). 
- [Quickstart Guide for using GitHub’s REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [REST API Guides](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides) - This guide will go over everything you need to know, from authentication to results manipulation to integrating results with other apps. Every tutorial will include a project, and each project will be saved and documented in our public [platform-samples](https://github.com/github/platform-samples) repository.
- [Best practices for using the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [Authenticating to the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [Learn how to resolve the most common problems people encounter in the REST API here.](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/troubleshooting?apiVersion=2022-11-28)

#### Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) or the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line).
- [Learn more about how you can use the REST API to manage fine-grained personal access tokens here.](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [Endpoints available for fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [Permissions required for fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28)

**Note 1:** Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on behalf of yourself. To access resources on behalf of an organization, or for long-lived integrations, you should use a GitHub App instead. For more information, see our resources on Using GitHub apps below. 

**Note 2:** Fine-grained PATs are in public beta. Related APIs, events, and functionality are subject to change.

### GraphQL API Resources
The GitHub GraphQL API offers more precise and flexible queries than the GitHub REST API. To learn more about creating integrations, retrieving data, and automating your workflows using the GitHub GraphQL API, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) or check out the resources below:
- [Introduction to GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql)

- [Migrating from REST to GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql)
- [Resource Limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/resource-limitations)
- [Changelog](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/changelog)

### Webhooks Resources
Webhooks can let your integrations take an action in response to events that occur on GitHub. You can set up, test, and secure webhooks so your integrations can subscribe and react to webhook events on GitHub. Learn where to start, what’s new and what’s popular here.

- [Integrating Jira with GitHub Enterprise Server](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/connect-a-github-enterprise-server-account-to-jira-software/)

### How Do I Check My Rate Limit?
- Read up on the feature and find any associated endpoints
  - [Overview - Rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-rate-limits) will explain rate limits at a high-level
- If the endpoint exists, create an example `curl` request to perform that action
  - The [Rate Limit API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/rate-limit) doc documents the endpoint for checking the authenticated user's current rate limit status
- The GraphQL API also has a custom rate limit that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API. For more information, see  our [Resource limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/resource-limitations#rate-limit) doc.
- Consider using conditional requests to help you stay within the rate limit. For more information about conditional requests, see our [Resources in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#conditional-requests) doc.
- If possible, consider using consolidated GraphQL queries instead of REST API requests to help you stay within rate limits. For more information, see "[About GitHub's APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/about-githubs-apis)" and "[GitHub GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)."

**Note:** If you hit a rate limit, you should stop making requests until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header. Failure to do so may result in the banning of your integration.

## 🗣️ Authenticating with OAuth apps and GitHub Apps

### Using OAuth Apps
- [Creating an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
  - [Best practices for creating an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/best-practices-for-creating-an-oauth-app)
- [Building OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps)
  - [Authorizing OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps)
- [Deleting an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/deleting-an-oauth-app)
- [Rate limits for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/rate-limits-for-oauth-apps)

When obtaining an OAuth token for a user, some errors may occur during the initial authorization request phase. You can learn more about troubleshooting common OAuth app errors here:
- [Troubleshooting authorization request errors](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/troubleshooting-authorization-request-errors)
- [Troubleshooting OAuth app access token request errors](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/troubleshooting-oauth-app-access-token-request-errors)

**GitHub Apps** are preferred to OAuth apps because they use fine-grained permissions, give more control over which repositories the app can access, and use short-lived tokens. These properties can harden the security of your app by limiting the damage that could be done if your app's credentials were leaked. They can also act independently of a user so the app will continue to work even if the person who installed the app on an organization leaves the organization. Check out these resources for more information:
- [Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps)
